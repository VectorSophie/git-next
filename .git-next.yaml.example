# git-next Configuration Example
# Place this file as .git-next.yaml in your repository root
# or as ~/.config/git-next/config.yaml for user-level defaults

# Protected branches - branches that should use merge instead of rebase
# and where force push is dangerous
protected_branches:
  - main
  - master
  - develop
  - staging
  - production

# Rule configuration
rules:
  # Disable specific rules by their ID
  # Uncomment to disable rules you don't want
  disabled:
    # - R007  # Don't nag about untracked files
    # - R008  # Don't suggest stash pop
    # - R035  # Don't suggest cleaning up merged branches
    # - R036  # Don't suggest cleaning up gone remote branches

  # Customize rule parameters/thresholds
  parameters:
    # R020: Soft reset threshold
    # How many commits can be soft reset before suggesting interactive rebase
    R020:
      max_commits: 3  # Default: 3

    # R022: Interactive rebase threshold
    # After how many commits should we suggest interactive rebase instead of soft reset
    R022:
      min_commits: 4  # Default: 4 (triggers when CommitCountSincePush > max_commits from R020)

# Advanced: Custom suppression rules
# WARNING: Modifying these can create conflicting or confusing advice
# Only change if you understand the suppression system
suppression:
  custom:
    # Example: Remove 'pull' from rebase suppression (allow both rebase and pull suggestions)
    # rebase: []

    # Example: Make 'commit' suppress 'add' suggestions
    # commit:
    #   - add
